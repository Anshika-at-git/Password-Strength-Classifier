## 🔐 Password Strength Classifier

It is a simple machine learning model that classifies a passwords as either **Weak**, **Medium**, or **Strong**, based on character patterns and length.

## 🔍 Classification Criteria

- **Weak**: 4–6 characters with lowercase letters and digits  
- **Medium**: 6–10 characters including lowercase, uppercase, and digits  
- **Strong**: 10–16 characters with lowercase, uppercase, digits, and special symbols like `@`, `&`, `*`

## Additional Info (^.^)

I created my own set of passwords due to lack of availability of password dataset online...

## 📄 Libraries I used

- Pandas, numpy (for generating and manipulating the data)
- Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression)
- matplot, seaborn (for data visualization)

## 🔎 Tools 🔍

* Google Colab
* Python

## 🧪 Features Extracted

- Password length  
- Presence of uppercase, lowercase, digits, symbols  
- Pattern-based features (regex)

## 📈 Model Performance

Used classification_report() for detailed evaluation.  
Also visualized results with a heatmap and bar charts for clarity...

## 💭 What I Learned

- How to build a synthetic dataset
- Extracting useful features from messy text data
- Evaluating models beyond just accuracy
- That attention to detail (like fixing 'yticklaels' 😅) really matters

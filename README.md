🔐 Password Strength Classifier

It is a simple machine learning model that classifies a password into any of these categories: *Weak*, *Medium* and lastly *Strong*
It classifies password into weak by analysing if the password contains 4 to 6 characters including lowercase and digits
Classifies a password as Medium by analysing if it contains 6 - 10 characters including lowercase, uppercase and digits like 1,2,3,4
Lastly it classifies the password as Strong if it contains 10 - 16 characters including lowercase, uppercase, digits and special symbols like &,*,@

📈 Model Performance

Used classification_report() for detailed evaluation.  
Also visualized results with a heatmap and bar charts for clarity...

💭 What I Learned

- How to build a synthetic dataset
- Extracting useful features from messy text data
- Evaluating models beyond just accuracy
- That attention to detail (like fixing 'yticklaels' 😅) really matters
